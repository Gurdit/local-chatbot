## NLTK Resources Script

Before running any NLP-related scripts, you need to download the necessary NLTK resources.

### Purpose
The `download_nltk_data.py` script sets up your environment for Natural Language Processing tasks by:
1. Fixing SSL certificate issues (if any) for securing HTTPS downloads.
2. Downloading required NLTK resources like:
   - Tokenization support (`punkt_tab`)
   - WordNet (`wordnet`) for lemmatization and lexical analysis
   - Multilingual extensions for WordNet (`omw-1.4`)

### Usage
Run the script using the following command:

```bash
 python3 download_nltk_data.py
```
