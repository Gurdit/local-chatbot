# ðŸš€ Python Code Explanation: Chatbot Model Creation

This document explains how the Python script in the `new.py` file builds and trains a machine learning model for a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and TensorFlow.

---

## **Overview**
The code implements the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**: Various libraries for data handling, NLP, and machine learning.
2. **Load Data**: Reads and initializes intent patterns and responses from the `intents.json` file.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Processes data into a numerical format for the model through tokenization, lemmatization, and creating a "bag of words."
4. **Prepare Training Data**: Converts text and classes into feature-label pairs for training.
5. **Build and Train the Neural Network**: Defines a sequential neural network with TensorFlow, compiles it, trains it, and saves the trained model.

---

## **1. Importing Libraries**
The script imports the following libraries:
- **`random`**: For shuffling data.
- **`json`**: To load data from the `intents.json` file.
- **`pickle`**: For saving preprocessed data structures.
- **`numpy`**: A library for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **`tensorflow`**: To create and train the neural network model.
- **`nltk`**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **`WordNetLemmatizer`** (from `nltk`): Reduces words to their root form (lemmatization).

---

## **2. Loading and Initializing Data**
- **Purpose**: Read `intents.json` to understand user intents and responses.
- The script extracts:
  - **Patterns**: Example sentences users might say.
  - **Tags**: Intent labels or categories for classification.
  - **Responses**: Bot replies (not used here but relevant for predictions).
- These are stored in:
  - `words`: A list of tokenized and cleaned words.
  - `classes`: Unique intent tags.
  - `documents`: Pairings of example sentences and their related tags.

---

## **3. Text Preprocessing**
### Tokenization and Lemmatization
- **Tokenization**: Break sentences into individual words using `nltk.word_tokenize`.
- **Lemmatization**: Convert words to their base form with `WordNetLemmatizer`.
- **Cleaning**:
  - Removes punctuation marks (`['?', '!', '.', ',']`) during preprocessing.
  - Ensures all words used for training are standardized.

### Output
- **`words`**: Unique, sorted vocabulary of lemmatized words.
- **`classes`**: Unique, sorted list of intent tags.

---

## **4. Saving Preprocessed Data**
### Why Save?
- Processed `words` and `classes` are stored in `words.pkl` and `classes.pkl` files using Pickle. This prevents reprocessing for future runs.

---

## **5. Creating Training Data**
### Bag of Words Representation
- For each example sentence, the script creates a **binary vector** of vocabulary size, where:
  - `1`: Indicates the word's presence.
  - `0`: Indicates absence.

### One-Hot Encoding of Labels
- Labels (intent tags) are converted into a one-hot encoded vector representing all classes. For e.g., the class index is `1` for the corresponding tag and `0` otherwise.

### Final Training Dataset
- Combines:
  - **Bag of Words (input)**: Numerical representation of sentences.
  - **One-Hot Labels (output)**: Class representation.
- Data is shuffled for better training.

## **6. Building and Training the Model**
A **Sequential Neural Network** is created and trained using `TensorFlow`. Here are the specifics:

### Model Architecture
1. **Input Layer**:
   - A dense layer with `128` neurons activated by ReLU.
   - Requires input shape as `len(trainX[0])`, i.e., the length of the bag of words.
2. **Dropout**:
   - 50% neurons randomly disabled to prevent overfitting.
3. **Hidden Layer**:
   - A dense layer with `64` neurons activated by ReLU.
4. **Output Layer**:
   - Number of neurons equals the number of classes.
   - Uses `softmax` activation to produce probabilities for each class.

### Optimizer and Loss Function
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum for faster and stable convergence.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy since it's a multi-class classification task.
- **Metrics**: Tracks accuracy to evaluate model performance during training.

### Training
- **Input**: Features (`trainX`) and labels (`trainY`).
- **Configuration**:
  - `Epochs`: 200 (number of iterations over the dataset).
  - `Batch Size`: 5 (number of samples per training step).

## **7. Saving the Trained Model**
The trained model is saved as `chatbot_model.h5` for future predictions. This ensures the chatbot can use the model without retraining.

---

## **Workflow Summary**
1. Load `intents.json` and preprocess text data.
2. Tokenize, lemmatize, and clean words; encode labels as one-hot vectors.
3. Prepare feature-label pairs using a bag of words.
4. Build and train a neural network to classify intents.
5. Save the model and preprocessed data for later use.

## ðŸ”§ Key Files in Project
- **`new.py`**: Implements the chatbot training pipeline described above.
- **`intents.json`**: Defines user intents, patterns, and responses. (See [intents_json.md](intents_json.md).)
- **`chatbot_model.h5`**: Trained neural network model saved for making predictions.
- **`words.pkl` & `classes.pkl`**: Saved preprocessed vocabulary and classes.
